# Movie Genre Classification

This project is a machine learning application that predicts movie genres based on plot summaries. It leverages Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques such as TF-IDF vectorization, and applies various classifiers like Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, and SVM to build robust models.

## Features

- Data preprocessing and TF-IDF vectorization
- Multi-label genre classification
- Evaluation with metrics like accuracy, precision, recall
- Model comparison and insights

## Requirements

- Python 3.7+
- Jupyter Notebook
- scikit-learn
- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- nltk (for tokenization/stemming if used)

Install dependencies with:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
